# Log Optimization Summary

## Problem
Excessive debug logging during file transfers was causing:
- Log buffer overflow ("messages dropped")
- System slowdown
- UART disconnection
- Poor transfer performance

## Solution
Reduced logging frequency while maintaining useful information:

### Before:
- Every chunk read/write was logged
- ~120 log messages for a 61KB file
- Debug messages flooding the system

### After:
- Log every 10th chunk operation
- Progress updates every 8KB (showing percentage)
- Only log slow operations (>100ms)
- Critical errors still logged immediately

## Expected Output
```
[INFO] Filesystem: 512 KB free of 1024 KB total
[INFO] Writing audio to temporary file: /lfs/temp_audio.opus
[INFO] Reading chunk 0: 1024 bytes (remaining: 61142)
[INFO] Reading chunk 10: 1024 bytes (remaining: 50902)
[INFO] Progress: 13% (8192/61142 bytes)
[INFO] Reading chunk 20: 1024 bytes (remaining: 40662)
[INFO] Progress: 26% (16384/61142 bytes)
[WARN] Slow fs_write: 156 ms for 512 bytes  // Only if slow
[INFO] Progress: 39% (24576/61142 bytes)
...
[INFO] Loop complete - bytes_written: 61142, remaining: 0
[INFO] All data read successfully, closing file...
[INFO] Audio file written: 61142 bytes
```

## Performance Benefits
1. Reduced CPU overhead from logging
2. No log buffer overflow
3. Faster file transfers
4. Stable UART connection
5. Still get useful progress information

## Debug Mode
If detailed debugging is needed, change LOG_INF to LOG_DBG in the 
loop_count % 10 checks to restore verbose logging.
