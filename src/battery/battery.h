 *
 * This module provides battery voltage measurement and estimation functionality for embedded systems
 * based on the Zephyr RTOS. It uses the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to sample battery voltage
 * directly or through a resistive divider, depending on devicetree configuration.
 *
 * Based on Zephyrâ€™s "Battery Voltage Measurement" sample.
