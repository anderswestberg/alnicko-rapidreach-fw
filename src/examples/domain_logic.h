 *
 * This example shows how to integrate and coordinate various firmware components,
 * including the power supervisor, audio codec and Opus decoder, test server (Alnicko),
 * LED/button/switch handling, and networking (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LTE, HTTP).
 * Intended to be called from main(), it serves as a practical template for application logic.

/**
 * @brief Demonstration entry point for domain logic showcasing
 *        interaction with firmware modules.
 *
 * This function serves as a minimal example application to demonstrate how
 * various firmware components—such as the audio codec, Opus decoder,
 * networking stack, and power supervisor—can be integrated and executed together.
 *
 * It is intended to be called directly from the main function. The logic demonstrates:
 * - Firmware confirmation and version reporting
 * - Network auto-connect and event handling
 * - Periodic watchdog pinging
 * - Audio file download and playback
 *
 * This function is intended for developers as a example for integrating
 * their own domain logic using the provided firmware infrastructure.
