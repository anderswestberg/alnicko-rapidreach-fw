# MQTT CLI Bridge Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **MQTT Module**:
   - MQTT client connects successfully to broker at 192.168.2.62:1883
   - Heartbeat publishing works (every 30 seconds)
   - Auto-reconnection is enabled
   - Publishing messages works fine

2. **CLI Bridge Framework**:
   - Command structure added to CLI (`rapidreach mqtt cli`)
   - Enable/disable/status commands work
   - Command and response topics are properly formatted
   - Work queue for asynchronous command execution is set up

3. **Device Functionality**:
   - All CLI commands work via USB serial
   - LED control, battery status, device info all functional

## ‚ùå What's Not Working

1. **MQTT Subscription**: The main issue is that `mqtt_module.c` doesn't implement the MQTT subscribe functionality needed for the CLI bridge to receive commands.

## üìù Required Changes

To complete the MQTT CLI bridge implementation, we need to:

1. **Extend mqtt_module.c** to add subscription support:
   ```c
   // Add to mqtt_module.h:
   typedef void (*mqtt_message_handler_t)(const char *topic, const char *payload, size_t len);
   mqtt_status_t mqtt_subscribe(const char *topic, uint8_t qos, mqtt_message_handler_t handler);
   mqtt_status_t mqtt_unsubscribe(const char *topic);
   
   // Add to mqtt_module.c:
   - Implement subscription list management
   - Handle incoming PUBLISH messages in mqtt_evt_handler
   - Route messages to registered handlers
   ```

2. **Update mqtt_cli_bridge.c** to:
   - Subscribe to command topic when enabled
   - Unsubscribe when disabled

## üß™ Testing Steps (Once Complete)

1. **Device Setup**:
   ```bash
   rapidreach mqtt init
   rapidreach mqtt connect
   rapidreach mqtt cli enable
   rapidreach mqtt heartbeat start
   ```

2. **Remote Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Subscribe to responses
   mqttx sub -t "rapidreach/rapidreach_device/cli/response" -h 192.168.2.62
   
   # Terminal 2 - Send commands
   mqttx pub -t "rapidreach/rapidreach_device/cli/command" -m "rapidreach led on green" -h 192.168.2.62
   mqttx pub -t "rapidreach/rapidreach_device/cli/command" -m "rapidreach device info" -h 192.168.2.62
   ```

## üîß Current Workaround

Until MQTT subscription is implemented, the device can only:
- Publish messages (heartbeat, responses)
- Be controlled via USB serial

The framework is ready, but the MQTT subscription capability needs to be added to complete the feature.
