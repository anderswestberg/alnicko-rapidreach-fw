 * This file contains an array of trusted CA root certificates used for
 * establishing secure HTTPS (TLS) connections. 
 *
 * HTTPS support in this module is enabled via the `RPR_ENABLE_HTTPS` Kconfig flag.
 * When enabled, it also selects `MBEDTLS_PEM_CERTIFICATE_FORMAT` to support PEM-encoded
 * certificates. If your certificates are in DER format, you may disable PEM support.
